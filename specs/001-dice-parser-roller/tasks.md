# Tasks: Dice Expression Parser and Roller

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-dice-parser-roller/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are NOT explicitly requested in the spec - tasks focus on implementation only. The spec mandates TDD approach per Constitution Check, but test creation will be part of implementation workflow (Red-Green-Refactor).

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `- [ ] [ID] [P?] [Story?] Description`

- **Checkbox**: ALWAYS `- [ ]` (markdown checkbox)
- **[ID]**: Task ID (T001, T002, T003...)
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1, US2, etc.) - only for user story phases
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

Single library project structure: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root per plan.md

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-13)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can proceed in parallel (if staffed) OR
  - Sequentially in priority order: P1 → P2 → P3 → P4 → P5 → P5a → P6 → ... → P10
- **Polish (Phase 14)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

All user stories are designed to be independently testable, but they build incrementally:

- **US1 (Basic Rolling)**: Foundation - no dependencies after Phase 2
- **US2 (Arithmetic)**: Extends US1 parser/roller - can work independently
- **US3 (Advantage)**: Extends US1 roller - can work independently
- **US4 (Success Counting)**: Extends US1 roller - can work independently
- **US5 (Reroll)**: Extends US1 roller - can work independently
- **US5a (Exploding Dice)**: Extends US1/US5 roller - can work independently, shares infrastructure with rerolls
- **US6 (Special Dice)**: Extends US1 parser/roller - can work independently
- **US7 (Placeholders)**: Extends US2 parser - can work independently
- **US8 (Comparisons)**: Extends US2 parser - can work independently
- **US9 (Criticals)**: Extends US1 roller - can work independently
- **US10 (Statistics)**: Uses calculator from US1 - validates all previous stories

### Parallel Opportunities

Tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (different files). US5 and US5a share similar infrastructure (reroll mechanics), so they could be developed together by coordinating on the roller architecture.

## Validation Checkpoints

### After Each User Story

1. Run integration tests for that story
2. Verify story works independently
3. Run full test suite to ensure no regressions
4. Check code coverage still >= 90%
5. Run PHPStan and PHP-CS-Fixer
6. Commit with message: "feat: Implement [User Story N] - [Title]"

### Before Release (v1.0.0)

1. All 145 tasks completed and checked off
2. Constitution check passed (all 8 principles verified)
3. Success criteria SC-001 through SC-007 all met
4. All 41 functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-041) implemented
5. Game system contract tests passing (D&D, Shadowrun, FATE, Savage Worlds, etc.)
6. Performance benchmarks met (parse <100ms, roll <50ms)
7. Documentation complete and accurate

## Notes

- **TDD Workflow**: Follow Red-Green-Refactor for each task per constitution
- **[P] markers**: Tasks in different files with no dependencies can run in parallel
- **[Story] labels**: Enable traceability from tasks back to user requirements
- **Edge Case Coverage**: All FR-026 through FR-041 validation requirements included
- **Exploding Dice**: US5a builds on similar infrastructure as US5 (rerolls) but with additive behavior
- **Quality Gates**: Run PHPStan + PHP-CS-Fixer + PHPUnit before each commit

## Error Handling Requirements

All validation tasks enforce error handling per FR-037:

- **Dice constraints** (FR-027, FR-028, FR-029, FR-030): Tasks T028-T032, T038
- **Arithmetic** (FR-031, FR-032, FR-033): Tasks T044, T045, T047, T052
- **Modifiers** (FR-034): Tasks T056, T061
- **Reroll** (FR-005b): Tasks T073, T074, T079
- **Explode** (FR-038c): Tasks T083, T084, T085, T091
- **Criticals** (FR-035, FR-036): Tasks T117, T121
- **Placeholders** (FR-009a): Tasks T104, T108

All error messages must identify problem, indicate location, and specify expectations.
