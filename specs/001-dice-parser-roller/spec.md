# Feature Specification: Dice Expression Parser and Roller

**Feature Branch**: `001-dice-parser-roller`
**Created**: 2025-12-02
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "The library provides: a dice expression parser and a dice roller. The parser shall support all possible game systems with supported roll expressions: Basic expression (e.g. 4d6), modifiers (e.g. 1d20+12), advantage (roll n times and keep m rolls, for dnd5 roll 1d20 2 times and keep highest), disadvantage (same but keep lowest), rerolls if equal or below a threshold, success counting (all dice above a threshold), fudge dices, percent dices, placeholders (1d20+str+luck), success rolls (1d20 >= 18), critical success thresholds (e.g. natural 20), critical failure thresholds (e.g. natural 1). A parsed dice expression shall be returned in a well documented data structure that can be passed to the dice roller. The data structure shall also allow to get statistic data for the roll such as minimal value, maximal value, expected value. The dice roller shall evaluate the parsed roll expression and return the result of the roll in a well documented data structure. The result shall contain: all data from the roll request (see above), the result, all rolled dices (without any modifiers), flags for critical success or failures. On success counting, the result number shall be the number of successes instead of the rolled sum."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-12-02

- Q: When a placeholder variable is referenced in a roll expression but not provided at roll time (e.g., "1d20+%str%" rolled without binding "str"), what should happen? → A: Reject with clear error message listing missing variables
- Q: How should reroll mechanics handle potentially infinite reroll scenarios (e.g., "4d6 reroll <= 6" on a d6 where every result would trigger another reroll)? → A: Reroll once only (single reroll attempt per die)
- Q: What is the minimum PHP version the library must support? → A: PHP 8.0
- Q: What should happen when advantage/disadvantage is requested with invalid parameters (e.g., "roll 3d6 keep 5 highest" where you're trying to keep more dice than you rolled)? → A: Reject at parse time with validation error
- Q: When should critical success/failure thresholds be specified - at parse time (part of the expression syntax) or at roll time (as parameters to the roll function)? → A: Parse time (expression syntax)
- Q: When should placeholder variables be bound - at parse time or roll time? → A: Parse time (required for statistical calculations to work)
- Q: What syntax should be used for placeholder variables to avoid collisions with reserved keywords? → A: Use %name% prefix/suffix syntax (e.g., "1d20+%str%+%dex%")
- Q: Should the parser support full arithmetic expressions beyond simple addition/subtraction? → A: Yes, support parentheses for grouping and mathematical functions: floor(), ceiling(), round()

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Basic Dice Rolling (Priority: P1)

As a game developer, I need to parse and roll basic dice expressions so that my players can perform simple dice rolls for their game actions.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational functionality that every dice rolling library must support. All other features build upon basic dice parsing and rolling. Without this, no dice rolling is possible.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by parsing expressions like "3d6", "1d20", "2d10" and rolling them to get numeric results. Delivers immediate value as a minimal viable dice roller.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a dice expression "3d6", **When** I parse the expression, **Then** I receive a data structure describing 3 six-sided dice
2. **Given** a parsed expression for "3d6", **When** I roll the dice, **Then** I receive a result containing the sum and individual die values
3. **Given** a dice expression "1d20", **When** I parse and roll it, **Then** the result is between 1 and 20 inclusive
4. **Given** a rolled result, **When** I inspect it, **Then** I can see all individual die values before summation

---

### User Story 2 - Modifiers and Arithmetic (Priority: P2)

As a game developer, I need to support dice expressions with arithmetic modifiers so that players can apply bonuses and penalties to their rolls.

**Why this priority**: Nearly all tabletop RPGs require adding or subtracting modifiers from dice rolls (e.g., ability bonuses, situational modifiers). This is essential for most game systems. Support for multiplication, division, parentheses, and mathematical functions enables complex calculations.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by parsing "1d20+5", "2d6-2", "3d8+12", "(2d6+3)*2", "floor(1d20/2)" and verifying results include correct arithmetic evaluation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an expression "1d20+5", **When** parsed, **Then** the structure shows one d20 plus a modifier of +5
2. **Given** a parsed "1d20+5", **When** rolled, **Then** the final result equals the d20 roll plus 5
3. **Given** an expression "2d6-3", **When** rolled, **Then** the result equals the sum of 2d6 minus 3
4. **Given** an expression "(2d6+3)*2", **When** rolled, **Then** the result equals (sum of 2d6 plus 3) multiplied by 2
5. **Given** an expression "floor(1d20/2)", **When** rolled, **Then** the result is the floor of (1d20 divided by 2)
6. **Given** a rolled result with complex arithmetic, **When** inspected, **Then** I can see the dice values and the final calculated result

---

### User Story 3 - Advantage and Disadvantage (Priority: P3)

As a game developer, I need to support advantage/disadvantage mechanics so that I can implement D&D 5e and similar systems where players roll multiple times and keep the best or worst.

**Why this priority**: Critical for D&D 5e compatibility and other modern RPG systems. Advantage/disadvantage is a core mechanic that affects nearly every roll in these games.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by rolling with advantage (2d20 keep highest), disadvantage (2d20 keep lowest), and verifying the correct die is selected.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an expression "1d20 advantage" (roll 2, keep highest), **When** rolled, **Then** the result shows both rolls and uses the higher value
2. **Given** an expression "1d20 disadvantage" (roll 2, keep lowest), **When** rolled, **Then** the result shows both rolls and uses the lower value
3. **Given** generalized "roll N keep M highest", **When** rolled with 4d6 keep 3 highest, **Then** the result discards the lowest die
4. **Given** a rolled advantage/disadvantage result, **When** inspected, **Then** I can see all dice rolled and which were kept vs discarded

---

### User Story 4 - Success Counting (Priority: P4)

As a game developer, I need success counting mechanics so that I can support dice pool systems like Shadowrun, World of Darkness, and FATE where success is measured by counting dice above a threshold.

**Why this priority**: Essential for dice pool-based game systems. These systems don't sum dice but count how many exceed a target number.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by rolling expressions like "5d6 count successes >= 4" and verifying the result is a count, not a sum.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an expression "5d6 success threshold 4", **When** rolled, **Then** the result is a count of dice showing 4 or higher
2. **Given** a success counting roll, **When** inspected, **Then** I can see which individual dice counted as successes and which didn't
3. **Given** an expression "10d10 >= 7", **When** rolled, **Then** only dice showing 7, 8, 9, or 10 contribute to the success count
4. **Given** a success counting result, **When** statistical data is requested, **Then** expected value represents average number of successes

---

### User Story 5 - Reroll Mechanics (Priority: P5)

As a game developer, I need reroll mechanics so that players can reroll dice that meet certain conditions (e.g., reroll all 1s and 2s).

**Why this priority**: Common in many game systems for handling critical failures or improving poor rolls. Adds strategic depth and game balance.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by rolling "4d6 reroll <= 2" and verifying that any initial rolls of 1 or 2 are rerolled once.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an expression "4d6 reroll <= 2", **When** rolled, **Then** any die showing 1 or 2 is rerolled exactly once (no recursive rerolls)
2. **Given** a reroll result, **When** inspected, **Then** I can see which dice were rerolled and their original values
3. **Given** a reroll expression, **When** parsed, **Then** the structure includes the reroll threshold condition
4. **Given** multiple reroll-eligible dice, **When** rolled, **Then** each is rerolled independently

---

### User Story 6 - Special Dice Types (Priority: P6)

As a game developer, I need support for fudge dice and percentile dice so that I can implement FATE and percentile-based game systems.

**Why this priority**: Required for specific game systems. Fudge dice (FATE) show +1/0/-1 instead of numbers. Percentile dice generate 1-100 results.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by rolling "4dF" (fudge) and "1d100" or "d%" (percentile) and verifying appropriate value ranges.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an expression "4dF" (fudge dice), **When** rolled, **Then** each die shows -1, 0, or +1 and they are summed
2. **Given** a fudge dice result, **When** inspected, **Then** I can see individual die values as -1, 0, or +1
3. **Given** an expression "1d100" or "d%", **When** rolled, **Then** the result is between 1 and 100 inclusive
4. **Given** percentile dice, **When** rolled, **Then** the result shows how the percentage was generated (e.g., tens die + ones die)

---

### User Story 7 - Placeholders and Variables (Priority: P7)

As a game developer, I need placeholder support in expressions so that I can create reusable roll templates with character-specific values (e.g., "1d20+%str%+%luck%").

**Why this priority**: Enables dynamic roll evaluation where modifiers come from character attributes. Critical for character sheet integration.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by parsing "1d20+%str%+%proficiency%", providing variable values, and rolling to get correct results.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an expression "1d20+%str%+%luck%" with variable values provided (str=3, luck=2), **When** parsed, **Then** the structure resolves "%str%" and "%luck%" placeholders to their numeric values
2. **Given** a parsed expression with resolved placeholders, **When** rolled, **Then** the roll evaluates correctly using the bound values
3. **Given** an expression with unbound placeholders, **When** parsed without providing values, **Then** the parser MUST reject the expression with a clear error message listing the missing variable names
4. **Given** a parsed expression with resolved placeholders, **When** inspected, **Then** I can see which placeholders were used and their bound values

---

### User Story 8 - Success Rolls and Comparisons (Priority: P8)

As a game developer, I need comparison operators in expressions so that I can evaluate whether a roll meets a target number (e.g., "1d20+5 >= 15" returns true/false).

**Why this priority**: Many game systems require checking if a roll beats a difficulty class or target number. This enables pass/fail evaluation.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by rolling "1d20+3 >= 15" and receiving a boolean success indicator along with the actual roll value.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an expression "1d20 >= 15", **When** rolled, **Then** the result includes both the die value and a success/failure flag
2. **Given** a comparison expression, **When** the roll meets the threshold, **Then** the success flag is true
3. **Given** a comparison expression, **When** the roll fails the threshold, **Then** the success flag is false
4. **Given** a success roll result, **When** inspected, **Then** I can see the actual roll value, the threshold, and the success status

---

### User Story 9 - Critical Success and Critical Failure (Priority: P9)

As a game developer, I need critical success and critical failure detection so that I can identify exceptional roll outcomes (e.g., natural 20 or natural 1 on a d20).

**Why this priority**: Critical hits and fumbles are iconic RPG mechanics that create memorable moments. Essential for proper game system support.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by configuring critical thresholds (e.g., 20 for success, 1 for failure on d20) and rolling until criticals occur.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a d20 roll with critical success threshold 20, **When** a natural 20 is rolled, **Then** the result is flagged as a critical success
2. **Given** a d20 roll with critical failure threshold 1, **When** a natural 1 is rolled, **Then** the result is flagged as a critical failure (glitch)
3. **Given** custom critical thresholds specified in the expression syntax at parse time, **When** parsed, **Then** the parser captures the threshold values in the DiceExpression structure
4. **Given** a critical result, **When** inspected, **Then** I can see which die value triggered the critical and the threshold that was configured
5. **Given** multiple dice rolled, **When** any single die is critical, **Then** the result is flagged appropriately

---

### User Story 10 - Statistical Analysis (Priority: P10)

As a game developer, I need statistical data for parsed expressions so that I can display probability information to players (minimum, maximum, expected values).

**Why this priority**: Valuable for game balance testing, player education, and UI enhancements. Non-critical for basic functionality but enhances user experience.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by parsing "3d6+5" and querying for min (8), max (23), and expected value (15.5) without rolling.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a parsed expression "3d6+5", **When** I request statistics, **Then** I receive minimum value (8), maximum value (23), and expected value (15.5)
2. **Given** a complex expression with advantage, **When** statistics are calculated, **Then** they reflect the keep-highest mechanic
3. **Given** a success counting expression, **When** statistics are requested, **Then** expected value represents average number of successes
4. **Given** any valid expression, **When** parsed, **Then** statistical data is available without performing a roll

---

### Edge Cases

The parser MUST fail with clear, actionable error messages for all invalid inputs. The following edge cases define required validation and error handling:

#### Invalid Dice Expressions

- **Invalid syntax** (e.g., "abc", "d", "3d", "xyz+5"): Parser MUST reject with error identifying the invalid syntax at the specific position
- **Malformed dice notation** (e.g., "d6" without number, "3d" without sides): Parser MUST reject with error indicating missing required component

#### Dice Constraints Validation

- **Zero dice** (e.g., "0d6"): Parser MUST reject - number of dice must be at least 1
- **Negative dice** (e.g., "-3d6"): Parser MUST reject - number of dice cannot be negative
- **Zero sides** (e.g., "3d0"): Parser MUST reject - dice must have at least 1 side
- **Negative sides** (e.g., "2d-5"): Parser MUST reject - dice cannot have negative sides
- **Excessive dice count in expression** (e.g., "101d6", "50d8+52d10"): Parser MUST reject when total dice across entire expression exceeds 100
- **Excessive sides on single die** (e.g., "1d101", "2d150"): Parser MUST reject when any single die has more than 100 sides

#### Arithmetic Expression Validation

- **Division by zero** (e.g., "1d20/0", "2d6/(3-3)"): Parser MUST reject with error identifying division by zero
- **Mathematical function with missing argument** (e.g., "floor()", "ceiling()", "round()"): Parser MUST reject with error indicating required argument missing
- **Mathematical function with invalid argument count** (e.g., "floor(1d20, 5)" with too many args): Parser MUST reject with error about argument count
- **Parenthesis mismatch** (e.g., "(1d20+5", "2d6+3)", "((1d20)"): Parser MUST reject with error identifying unmatched parenthesis and its position

#### Modifier Conflicts and Validation

- **Conflicting advantage and disadvantage** (e.g., "1d20 advantage disadvantage"): Parser MUST reject - cannot apply both modifiers simultaneously
- **Invalid advantage/disadvantage parameters** (e.g., "roll 3d6 keep 5 highest"): Parser MUST reject when keep-count exceeds roll-count (already covered in FR-003a, FR-004a)

#### Critical Threshold Validation

- **Critical success threshold out of range** (e.g., "1d20 critical success >= 25"): Parser MUST reject when threshold exceeds maximum die value
- **Critical failure threshold out of range** (e.g., "1d20 critical failure <= 0"): Parser MUST reject when threshold is below minimum die value (typically 1)
- **Critical failure threshold out of range** (e.g., "1d6 glitch <= -1"): Parser MUST reject when critical failure threshold is outside valid die range [1, sides]

#### Placeholder Variable Validation

- **Unbound placeholder variables** (e.g., "1d20+%str%" parsed without providing "str" value): Parser MUST reject with error message listing all missing variable names (already covered in FR-009a)

#### Edge Case Interactions

- **Reroll infinite loop prevention** (e.g., "4d6 reroll <= 6" on a d6): Roller MUST reroll each die exactly once then accept result (already covered in FR-005a)
- **Success counting with fudge dice** (e.g., "4dF success >= 0"): Parser MUST accept and roller evaluates fudge dice (-1, 0, +1) against threshold normally
- **Success counting with percentile dice** (e.g., "1d100 success >= 75"): Parser MUST accept and roller evaluates d100 result against threshold normally

#### Error Message Requirements

- All error messages MUST identify the specific problem (e.g., "division by zero", "unmatched opening parenthesis")
- All error messages SHOULD indicate the position/location in the expression where the error occurred when feasible
- All error messages for missing/invalid components MUST specify what was expected (e.g., "expected number of sides after 'd'")
- All error messages for constraint violations MUST specify the limit that was exceeded (e.g., "total dice count 105 exceeds maximum of 100")

- All code will be written in PHP 8.0+ with strict type declarations enabled
- PHPUnit will be used for all testing with minimum 90% code coverage
- The library will be stateless - each parse/roll operation is independent
- Randomness will use PHP's built-in random number generation (random_int preferred over mt_rand)

### Usage Assumptions

- Dice expressions will typically be under 100 characters in length
- Most use cases involve single rolls rather than batch rolling
- Developers integrating this library have basic understanding of tabletop RPG dice mechanics
- Critical thresholds are specified at parse time as part of expression syntax (not provided at roll time)
- Success counting thresholds are specified at parse time as part of expression syntax
- Placeholder variable values will be provided at parse time to enable statistical calculations

## Constraints *(optional)*

### Performance Constraints

- Expression parsing must complete in under 100ms for typical expressions (up to 50 characters)
- Rolling must complete in under 50ms for expressions with up to 100 total dice
- Memory usage should not exceed 1MB per roll operation

### Compatibility Constraints

- Must support PHP 8.0 and higher
- Must work on all major PHP platforms (Linux, Windows, macOS)
- Must be compatible with common PHP frameworks (Laravel, Symfony, etc.) without conflicts

### Scope Constraints

- Library focuses on dice expression parsing and rolling only - no game logic, character sheets, or persistence
- No GUI or web interface - this is a pure PHP library
- No network functionality - all operations are local
- Random number generation quality is limited to PHP's built-in capabilities (not cryptographically secure)

## Dependencies *(optional)*

### External Dependencies

- Minimal external dependencies to maintain library simplicity
- May require a parsing library for expression parsing (or implement custom parser)
- All dependencies must be justified and documented in composer.json

### Integration Points

- Library output (RollResult) should be easily serializable to JSON for API/web use
- DiceExpression structure should support persistence if developers want to save roll templates with resolved placeholders
- Placeholder mechanism requires character attribute values at parse time for statistical calculation support

## Out of Scope *(optional)*

The following are explicitly **NOT** part of this feature:

- **Character sheet management** - The library only rolls dice; it doesn't store character data
- **Game rules engines** - The library provides mechanics but doesn't enforce game-specific rules
- **User interface** - No CLI, web UI, or GUI components
- **Persistence/database** - No built-in saving or loading of expressions or results
- **Network features** - No multiplayer, remote rolling, or online functionality
- **Probability visualization** - Statistical data is provided, but graphing/charting is out of scope
- **Natural language parsing** - Expressions must follow defined syntax; no "roll three six-sided dice" text parsing
- **Macro/scripting system** - No complex roll sequences or conditional logic
- **Random number generation alternatives** - No custom RNG algorithms or cryptographic randomness
- **Dice rolling history/logging** - Each roll is independent; no built-in audit trail

## Related Features *(optional)*

### Future Enhancement Opportunities

- **Expression builder API**: Programmatic construction of dice expressions without string parsing
- **Roll history tracking**: Optional component for maintaining roll audit trails
- **Probability distribution calculator**: Detailed probability tables for complex expressions
